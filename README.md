# Elude

### Deprecation

There was a time when Elude was a small standard library replacement for Reason/Bucklescript. It has since been superseded by [Relude](https://github.com/reazen/relude/). Most functions in Elude have been rewritten as aliases to the equivalent functions in Relude.

- For more expansive utilities for working with basic types like Option, List, Array, Result, use [Relude](https://github.com/reazen/relude/)
- For better JSON decoding utilities, use [bs-decode](https://github.com/mlms13/bs-decode)
- For an `ordering` type that is used more consistently, use [bs-abstract's ordering](https://github.com/Risto-Stevcev/bs-abstract)
